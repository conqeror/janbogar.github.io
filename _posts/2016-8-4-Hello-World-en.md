Hello world! This is my first post at this blog. Over time I will be posting here various comments and articles about travel, science or anything that strikes my fancy at the moment. Some posts will be in english, some in slovak, hopefully most will be in both translations.

For those who are interested in technical details, I decided to migrate to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) after unfinished (but more or less functional) atempt to create my own static site generator in Python. Jekyll is an open-source generator specialised for blogs. In layman terms, it's a program that automaticaly creates website out of text documents with content. You can find plenty of tutorials on the net, as well as a lot of free themes you can immediately use for your blog without any tweaking. Design of this site is based on the theme [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). Site itself is hosted at Github, which directly supports Jekyll sites and hosts them for free.

For now it's all from me, but there will be more soon. Aloha!
